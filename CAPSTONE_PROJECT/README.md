My name is Zanele Maseko and this is my capstone project.
I have chosen to build a basic quiz app with react.
I utilise basic htm, tailwindcss, javascript and react+vite to make my project come to life.
It uses an api from OpenTriviaDatabase to fetch questions and display the question on the UI along with multiple choice
answers and keeps track of your score for the end of the quiz. 
The lapnging page diplaays a welcome message with the users name and an error message if they have left the input black, from there 
there is a button that links to the quiz page(main page).
I have  also added a dark mode that turns the background black and text gray or white.
It took me 3 weeks of constant building along with countless trial and error and having to re-learn or learn new concepts.
I can proudly say that i build this project from the ground up. I had no base code or blue print. I had to use my own knowledge, creativity 
and the skills i learnt during the 14 weeks or mini projects at alx.
